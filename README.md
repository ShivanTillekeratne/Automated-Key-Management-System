# Automated-Key-Management-System
This is our 1st Year hardware Project for our BSc Hons in Artificial Intelligence Degree. 

## Introduction
The AKMS aims to address inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities in conventional key management systems used in institutions like schools, universities, and offices.
# Key Components and Features:

## Hardware:
Utilizes Arduino UNO microcontroller, AS608 Fingerprint module, A3144 Hall effect sensors, Keypad 3x4, I2C expander module PCF8574T, push buttons, L298N Stepper motor drivers, Nema 17 Stepper motors, LCD display 16x2, Node MCU, SG90 Servo motor, and LEDs.
Designed with a database and a webpage for seamless user interaction and data management.

## Software:
Implements various C algorithms for hardware functionalities.
Uses MySQL for database management and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and PHP for the website.

## Functionality:
Issuing and Returning Keys: Automated processes ensure secure and efficient management of keys.
Security: Fingerprint authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
Operational Efficiency: Minimizes human intervention and reduces errors associated with manual key management.

## Evaluation:
Tested with various use cases to ensure functionality, accuracy, and security.
Successfully authenticated users, issued and returned keys, and recorded all transactions in the database.

## Conclusion:
The AKMS enhances security and operational efficiency in key management.
Future improvements include increasing key storage capacity and enhancing security mechanismsâ€‹
